# Classical ciphers

They were all symmetric.

## Introduction

Cyptography used to be used by the powerful and the military.
With the rise of computers it's necessary for everyone to use cypto.

## Early ciphers

- symmetric
- subtitution or transposition
- pen & paper

- easy to break
- easy to ake mistakes

- Transposition
  Ex: Rail Fence
  Permutates the plaintext.
  Classicly done with some device (Ex: skytale)

  Rail Fence:
  THISISATEST
	|
	v
  T...I...E..
  .H.S.S.T.S.
  ..I...A...T
	|
	v
  TIEHSSTSIAT

  Could be improved:
  - Double encryption
  - combine with cipher

- Subsitution
  Ex: Ceaser
  Individual letters are replaced by other symbols.
  The order isn't changed.

  Multiple types:
  - monoalphabetic: 1 to 1
    Generalised ceaser: shift by a constant.
    Weaknesses:
    - Frquency analysis
    - Cribs
    - Underlying word or pattern
    
  - Homophonic: letters to more than one possibillity
    Ex: map each letter to a couple of numbers in 0-99
    Combats frequency analysis (choose more mappings for common letters such as 'e')

    Famous exampls:
    Beale ciphers

  - Polyalphabetic: mutiple alphabets at once (many-to-many)
    Ex: shift be a sequence of numbers. One single number would be generalised ceaser.

    Viginaire cipher (falsly attributed to Blaise de Vigen√®re)
    Initially thought to be unbreakable.
    Each cipher letter is derived by combining each key letter with the corresponding plaintext letter/
      - repeat until all plaintext is encrypted
    Selecting the key:
	- Cyclic key
	- Book
	- AutoKey
    
  - polygraphc: substitute groups.
   Ex: playfair
   Uses 5x5 square based on a keyword. Encrypt 2 letters at a time.
