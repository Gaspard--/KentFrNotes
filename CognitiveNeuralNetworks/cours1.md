# Highlevel overview

Connectionisme -> neural network

Symbolisme vs Connectionisme

Symbolisme -> assume the brain has recursion etc.
Start from the top.

Connectionisme starts from the raw components.

Hebbian learning; delta_w12 = A1 * A2

Supervised learning:
For every given pattern you know what pattern is expected. Allows backpropagation. Learn through error.

Unsupervised learning:
Extract patten from coprus of information.

Reinforcement learning:
Reward and punishment without explanation.

Learning rate.

Human brain has sall world property. Why isn't epilepsy more common?

Neuron -> detector
Neurons are passive. Detect concepts. Not binary (somehat broader tuning).
