# Transmission media

## Guided media

- signal is bounded inside the media

### Twisted Pair Cable

- twisting reduces interference
- used for ehternet & telephone

Twiting pushes up the shannon rate.

Data rate: several Mbps over kms or Gbps over shorter disance

#### Category 3 & 5

- Cat 3 for tlephone
- Cat 5 better

### Coaxial Cable (Coax)

- Superior shielding -> higher bandwidth & greater resistence to noise

Data rate: 1-2 gpbs over 1 km

### Shielded twister pair

-> combines advantages of Coaxical Cable & Category 3 / 5

### Fibre Optic Cable

Uses very transparent glassn surrounded by cladding that acts like a very good mirror.
Signals travels optically rather than electrically.

### Fibre Optic Data Rates

Bandwidth: 100 THz

- limiting factor is the conversion electricity <-> light

Rates around LAN: 100 Gpbs.
Higher rates achievable by using Dense WaveLEngth Division Multiplexing.

Latency about the same.

## Fibre Optic Ring Networks

- Fibre optics for the ring

- Ring only "turns" in one way

Dual ring: second ring turns the other way, to avoid single points of failure
Small delay because individual aplifiers only forward.

## Fibre optic vs. Copper Cable

Copper oxydates, much faster than glass corodes.

## Unguided media

Frequencies:

10⁴ - 10¹⁵

### Radio waves

Travels far, easy to generate.
-> More inteference.
Reduce power, to reduce range.

### High frequency radio waves

Requires LOS.

### Microwaves

Medium Range. Can be focused. +Securit +Range -Interference
Affected by weather (rain), can't pass obstacles.

# Ifrared and millimete Waves

Can't pass objects like windows and doors. (More secure)
Sun emits infrared.

Still used for Tv remotes.
