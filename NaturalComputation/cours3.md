Mass action dymaiss
Spcies 'A', 'B' rate 'k'

'k' is the rate constant.

Propensity of a reaction is givrn by:

Na * Nb * k


## Example 1: Nucletide sequence copying

Gene reulatory networks.
Some sequence of genes describe proteins.
Binding sites for other molecules, the presents or lack of binding can affect the production of other molecules.
The possible configurations exist for and, or and not gates, therfor this language is turing complete.

Living systems compute (no brain required, bacterias compute too).
However these sytems are stochastic. On very large systems the effect is not visible.
However on the scale of bacterias, errors are often present.
Noise-time tradeoff is not great at low energy. You can speed up calculation at the cost of precision.
This is actually appliable to any form of computation! (active area of research).
