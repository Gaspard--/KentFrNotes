# Cellular Automatata

To conditions:
1. Symmetry: This means x and ~x lead to the same result
2. Quiescent state: 000 maps to 0

Condigurations:
- Garden of eden: initial satate
- Transient

Wolfram classification of CAs

Class 1: Fixed points
- nearly all initial state lead to a uniform state fairly quickly
- exceptions decrease with time

Class 2: Period cycles
- Settle to periodic regime

Class 3: Chaos
- non-periodic (regularor irregular) behavior

Class 4: "Edge of Chaos"
- only ones usable for computation

## Class 4

- often have very long transient periods.
- most states will develop into the quiescent state

## The game of life (GOL)

The GOL is a 2D cellular automata. Uses Moore neighborhood.
GOL is turing complete.
